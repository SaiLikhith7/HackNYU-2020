Application to help visually challenged people.

We as a team of 4 people namely Harshul (hj1393@nyu.edu), Tanya (ts3813@nyu.edu) , Darren (darrenzhang200027@gmail.com, Sai Likhith Kanuparthi (slk522@nyu.edu), worked hard for almost 36 hours at streak for developing a web application using the technologies like computer vision, natural language processing and server-less computing.

Our application is of two parts as of now:
Part 1: Speech recognition for browser navigation
Part 2: OCR implementation to help visually impaired get the text from data.

### Part1 : Speech Recognition for application navigation:
Since, it's very difficult for visually challenged people to operate computers, we developed the built-in speech recognition for our application which would help the user to navigate through our application.

### Part2: OCR implementation and text to speech conversion:
This technology would help the specially aided people by reading out loud the things
